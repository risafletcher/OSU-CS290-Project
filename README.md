# OSU-CS290-Project

Midterm Project for Intro to Web Development

The application uses HandlebarsJS, express, express-handlebars, and cookie-parser.
Persistence via cookies is not necessarily the best choice but because the dataset here is limited and the requirements for
the project were strict, I was limited to the technologies mentioned above.

This project was built in 2 (long) nights. 

The app is mobile responsive and utilizes css-grid and in some places, flexbox (for the forms).
The application should also be fully accessible via keyboard-only imput and uses semantic HTML.
